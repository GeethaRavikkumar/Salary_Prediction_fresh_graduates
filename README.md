# HR_Analytics_Linear-Regression
Overview:

Goal: The goal of the problem is to predict the annual compensation at which a participant gets placed after graduating 
from college.For each registration number in the test set,  you must predict a salary for the CTC variable.

Metric to measure:
Your score is how much your predicted salary deviates from the actual salaries of the participants. This is simply known as accuracy.

Problem Statement:
The provided dataset consists of information related to multiple participants from diverse backgrounds who graduated from institutes 
across India and have got placed at different roles in different firms.

In this Hackathon, we aim to predict the annual compensation at which a participant will get placed once he/she graduates from his/her college.
We aim to determine the market worth of a graduate who has just finished college under the conditions that historic data is provided.

Dataset:
The problem consists of 3 separate datasets: Participant information, Recruitment Assessment data and Personality Test data. 
The Participant information has the profile information along with the placement information for every participant. 
The Recruitment Assessment data has score data for every participant who sits through the placement process. 
Similarly, the Personality test data has scores from a personality test conducted for all the participants.

You are expected to treat this as raw data and perform any necessary cleaning/validation steps as required.

Model Evaluation:
Each Model will get evaluated on the basis of RMSE. The model with the lowest RMSE will get ranked as the best model.
